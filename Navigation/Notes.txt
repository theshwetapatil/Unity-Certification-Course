NavMesh is an asset
Generate NavMesh- Window->Navigation->Bake
NavMeshAgent is required to do pathfinding on a NavMesh
Height can affect the NavMesh movement under obstacles

Make radius smaller, if AI isn't going through narrow spaces it could easily fit into
Descrease max slope property if AI is attempting slopes which are unrealistically steep
Changing step height modifies the maximum step the AI can climb

Baking with regards to navigation is creating a mesh from all navigable surfaces of the navigation static objects
NavMesh is an asset
Generate NavMesh- Window->Navigation->Bake
NavMeshAgent is required to do pathfinding on a NavMesh
Height can affect the NavMesh movement under obstacles

For going under a ledge, fix Height property of NavMesh
Make radius smaller, if AI isn't going through narrow spaces it could easily fit into
Descrease max slope property if AI is attempting slopes which are unrealistically steep
Changing step height modifies the maximum step the AI can climb

NavMesh Obstacle- To model dynamic obstacles
Carve property of NavMesh Obstacle- For an agent to find an efficient route around it when stationary
Obstacle carves a hole in NavMesh a short while after the object stops moving
When an agent doesn't carve the NavMesh it will do its best to avoid it but cannot route around it
When recarving occurs Move Threshold is affected

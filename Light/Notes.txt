Directional Light- Direction/Rotation matters, position doesn't matter (Sun)
Point Light- Position matters (Light bulb, Candle)
Spotlight- Mix between Directional Light and Point Light(Spotlight in stage production)
Area Light- Mostly for areas reflecting light

Draw Halo- Illuminates dust in the air
Cookie- Effect of window blinds
Point Light- Round cookie
Spotlight- Flat cookie

Culling Mask- Selection of layers prevfenting GameObjects from being illuminated by one light

Shadow Acne can be resoved using Bias and Normal Bias
Set walls and cube to Lightmap Static for baking light inside room/cave

Precamputed GI Benefits- Move Lights
Baked GI Benefits- Uses less resources, less gpu time, less memory (Better on mobile platforms)
Final Gather- To improve quality, computes last bounce of light at full Baked Resolution
Direct Illumination- Can cope with non-static objects in scene
Baked Resolution- Controls the resolution of the GI per Unity unit
Capsule UV mapping is quite hard
On increasing Auto UV Max Distance- More charts are merged if the Auto UV Max Angle permits
On decreasing Auto UV Max Angle- Increases the number of charts if any were merged

Baked GI takes a lot of time to compute always
Precomputed Realtime GI will recompute only if static geometry is moved
Charting- 3D objects converted into 2D textures by unwrapping into charts
Charts- Collection of vertices, often square
Preserve UV- To create automatic charting, Use UV Unwrapped provided by the artist
Uncheck Preserve UV to let Unity unwrap- to use less memory and run faster in Realtime GI
Auto UV Max Distance- Small value-> Very close together charts
Auto UV Max Angle- Small value-> Merged charts, number of charts goes down

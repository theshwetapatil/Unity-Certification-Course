Albedo- Base color of material
Metalic- 0-Plastic 1-Metalic, Smoothness- 1-Mirror
Normal Map- Adds surface detail efficiently
Height map/Dispalcement- Adds depth, leads to occlusion, parallax occlusion effect
Occlusion- Areas of model in shadow where non-direct light/double light is not bounced back
Emission- Creates the effect/illusion that the material is emitting light
Detail Mask- Adds secodary level to to identify some details, 
Advantage of Detail Mask- Add Low-Res texture + secondary map with more repeatitive detail
						  to reduce size of textures significantly
Tile increases, frequency of texture being repeated increases

Shader- A program that runs on GPU, not CPU
		Dectates how to shade surfaces of objects
Cutout Material- For object like grass, barbed wire
Specular Setup- Can change color of specular reflection
Fade Render Mode- Makes specular reflections transparent as well as diffuse reflections

Antialiacing through camera is deprecated. The correct way to do antialiacing is through quality settings
Antialiacing gets rid of sharp edges of objects

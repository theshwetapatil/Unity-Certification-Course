Albedo- Base color of material
Metalic- 0-Plastic 1-Metalic, Smoothness- 1-Mirror
Normal Map- Adds surface detail efficiently
Height map/Dispalcement- Adds depth, leads to occlusion, parallax occlusion effect
Occlusion- Areas of model in shadow where non-direct light/double light is not bounced back
Emission- Creates the effect/illusion that the material is emitting light
Detail Mask- Adds secodary level to to identify some details, 
Advantage of Detail Mask- Add Low-Res texture + secondary map with more repeatitive detail
						  to reduce size of textures significantly
Tile increases, frequency of texture being repeated increases

Albedo- Base color of material
Metalic- 0-Plastic 1-Metalic, Smoothness- 1-Mirror
Normal Map- Adds surface detail efficiently
Height map/Dispalcement- Adds depth, leads to occlusion, parallax occlusion effect
Occlusion- Areas of model in shadow where non-direct light/double light is not bounced back
Emission- Creates the effect/illusion that the material is emitting light
Detail Mask- Adds secodary level to to identify some details, 
Advantage of Detail Mask- Add Low-Res texture + secondary map with more repeatitive detail
						  to reduce size of textures significantly
Tile increases, frequency of texture being repeated increases

Shader- A program that runs on GPU, not CPU
		Dectates how to shade surfaces of objects
Cutout Material- For object like grass, barbed wire
Specular Setup- Can change color of specular reflection
Fade Render Mode- Makes specular reflections transparent as well as diffuse reflections

Antialiacing through camera is deprecated. The correct way to do antialiacing is through quality settings
Antialiacing gets rid of sharp edges of objects			
Regular motion blur applies to objects, camera motion blur applies if camera itself moves
Depth of Field allows to set focal distance
Titl Shift to blur from top or botom (Titl Shift Mode) OR radial (Iris Mode), Effient Depth of Field
Vignette and Chromatic Aberrarion useful for Cutback Scene
Noise and Scratches gives old school film look
Vortex gives bit more control than Twirl
Crease Shading important for FPS to detect edges, important to highlight objects/areas
Edge Detection gives more solid lines, useful for cartoon look

Max Particles- Ensures top performance

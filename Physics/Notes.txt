Is Kinematic- Moving selected Rigid Body in code
Anything with collider on it, has to be a rigidbody with Is Kinematic checked
Collider with no rigidbody is static as per Unity
Rigidbody stimulates physics of solid objects
When rigidbody component is added to gameobject in order for it ro interact with 
other objects, no need to add  collider if it already exists

Trigger Collider is a collider that doesn't prevent things from going through it
Mesh Collider should have Convex checked to enable Is Trigger
When Trigger Collider comes in contact with another GameObject with Collider Component,
it calls OnTriggerEnter() method on any Component of current GameObjects, if exists
Collider blocks physics objects but Trigger let them through

Is Kinematic- Moving selected Rigid Body in code
Anything with collider on it, has to be a rigidbody with Is Kinematic checked
Collider with no rigidbody is static as per Unity
Rigidbody stimulates physics of solid objects
When rigidbody component is added to gameobject in order for it ro interact with 
other objects, no need to add  collider if it already exists

Is Kinematic- Moving selected Rigid Body in code
Anything with collider on it, has to be a rigidbody with Is Kinematic checked
Collider with no rigidbody is static as per Unity
Rigidbody stimulates physics of solid objects
When rigidbody component is added to gameobject in order for it to interact with 
other objects, no need to add  collider if it already exists

Trigger Collider is a collider that doesn't prevent things from going through it
Mesh Collider should have Convex checked to enable Is Trigger
When Trigger Collider comes in contact with another GameObject with Collider Component,
it calls OnTriggerEnter() method on any Component of current GameObjects, if exists
Collider blocks physics objects but Trigger let them through
Add Is Kinematic property to  control objects position through its transform and not physics
To move collider programmatically, add rigidbody and set it to Kinematic

Raycast- Line is projected until it hits something then returns that point
Rigidbody+Collider- Solid object to move in code
Static Collider- Scenery which must block physics objects
Trigger Collider- Area of space which deals damage when entered
Raycast- Checking if an AI can see the player
